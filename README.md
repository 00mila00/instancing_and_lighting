# housing_estate

The main purpose of this task was to make a lot of identical houses with roofs. 
To avoid critical suspension of my computer i needed to make houses and its roofs instanced.
Other task was to make different light types and present their locations:
point lights, direct lights and spotlights in Phong lighting model.

See the screenshots how it looks ;)

I also added camera to move around the houses.

What can you do in this app:
- moving around the scene
- change houses properties e.g. scale the houses, changing its offsets in 3 dimensions (xyz), rotate them also you can do the same transformation on its roofs.
- change lights and sky color
- turn on and off added lights
- change lights position in the world
